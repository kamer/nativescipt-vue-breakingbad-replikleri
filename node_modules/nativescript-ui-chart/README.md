## Documentation

The **NativeScript UI Chart** plugin has two types of charts - chartesian and pie.
They are presented by the `RadChartesianChart` & `RadPieChart` classes.
Each of them can visualize data with different types of series. With the chartesian chart you can also specify the axes that are used.
